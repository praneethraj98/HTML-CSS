code: #box-1.box
  - creates a div of id: box-1 and class: box

  margin:auto -> moves the text to the middle

  max-width -> fit to the screen size 

  clear: both; -> to clear left and right float (or else there will be no space between divs (2,3) and 4)

 *** always use box-sizing when padding is used
